Created from DOLBYHPH.DLL (included with some software DVD players) and the following foobar2000 wrapper component
https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_dsp_dolbyhp

24 bits 48khz Stereo, impulses are gain-compensated

Good to add a rather natural and moderate sounding stereo effect to mono samples

* DH1 is designed to sound as a home theater setup (average effect)
* DH2 is designed to sound like a medium-sized room (more subtle effect)
* DH3 sounds like a large theater (strongest effect)
